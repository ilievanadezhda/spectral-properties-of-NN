# Spectral Properties of Neural Network Architectures and Optimization âœ¨

This repository contains code for analyzing the eigenvalue spectrum of Hessians of neural network architectures using the Lanczos algorithm.

## Overview

The codebase provides tools to:
- Train neural networks on standard datasets.
- Compute and analyze the Hessian matrix eigenvalue spectrum.
- Generate visualizations of the spectrum distribution.
